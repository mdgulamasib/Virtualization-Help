## **Solution: Restart the VirtualBox Service**
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**  
   - Press `Win + S`, type **CMD**, and select **Run as administrator**.

2. **Restart the VirtualBox support driver**  
   - Run the following command:  
     `net start vboxsup`  
   - If the service is already running, you may need to restart it using:  
     `net stop vboxsup`  
     `net start vboxsup`

3. **Reboot your computer (if necessary)**  
   - If the issue persists, try restarting your machine and then relaunch VirtualBox.

## **Final Thoughts**
This quick fix should help you get your Virtual Machine up and running again. If youâ€™re still facing issues, checking for VirtualBox updates or reinstalling the software might help.
